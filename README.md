# Two_Prong_BodyCord_WagoStyle

This project put together a 3D printed Two Prong Bodycord. The 3D model can be found at [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/28fdac54c1b03cab0d3b86e1/w/d4d30fa18e73995083e20fae/e/a1f624089b5958362320cc5d?renderMode=0&uiState=64a1b48e33e2270f43009ec6)

The goal of the bodycord is to robust and streamlined enough to use and be as easy as possible to fix. The majority of breaks in a bodycord are near the interface between the wire the two prong connector. The intend use is for a club setting where the bodycord will be loaned out to students. The asthetic has the added benefit of encouraging students to purchase their own bodycords.

I used a common [Wago style](https://www.wago.com/us/wire-splicing-connectors/inline-splicing-connector-with-lever/p/221-2401), lever connector to go between the wire and the 4mm and 3mm pins. This has the benefit of being easy to fix since you only need to trim the wire and lift the connectors lever. The actual connectors used were a [generic version](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803684080411.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt)

The bodycord overall is a bit more bulky than I would prefer and I have not incorporated a retaing clip into the cord.
